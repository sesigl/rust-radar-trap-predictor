# rust_radar_trap_predictor
Project to learn rust, which gets public available data for radar traps, stores it in some storage to train a prediction model for it. Although rust is not popular for such use-cases, I want to try rust and research if predicting radar traps is possible - for research. Data and outcome is only provided to selected contacts.
